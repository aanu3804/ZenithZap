          <p><strong>1. Importance of hydration in sports:</strong> Hydration is essential. Even 2% body weight loss can impair performance. It affects thermoregulation, joint lubrication, cardiovascular efficiency, digestion, and mood. Dehydration increases cramps, fatigue, and injury risk.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Pre-match nutrition (Protona):</strong> Protona is rich in carbs, moderate in protein, and low in fat/fiber. It fuels muscles, supports glycogen stores, and enhances focus before play begins.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Mid-match hydration (Electrona):</strong> Provides essential electrolytes and hydration for prolonged performance. Based on ACSM, 6–12 oz every 20 mins is recommended during activity.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Post-match recovery (Neutrona):</strong> Rehydrates and repairs muscles. Combines protein, carbs, and electrolytes. Best consumed within 30 minutes after activity for glycogen and muscle recovery.</p>
          <p><strong>5. Nutrition for grassroots athletes:</strong> Supplements and hydration support growth, health, and performance—even for amateur players.</p>
          <p><strong>6. Coach-led nutrition:</strong> Coaches play a crucial role by encouraging hydration breaks and proper refueling habits on the field.</p>
          <p><strong>7. Natural nutrition:</strong> A whole-food-rich diet supports long-term health, performance, and immunity.</p>
          <p><strong>8. Science-based formulations:</strong> Nutrition needs change pre-, during-, and post-match. Zenith Zap tailors support to each phase based on research.</p>
          <p><strong>9. Functional foods:</strong> Our drinks include nutrients that reduce inflammation, boost recovery, and improve immunity (like antioxidants, BCAAs).</p>
          <p><strong>10. Electrolyte balance:</strong> Sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium aid nerve function and prevent cramps. Balanced drinks = better muscle performance.</p>
          <p><strong>11. Energy on game day:</strong> Proper hydration and carbs support stamina and focus. Personalized plans improve endurance and cognition.</p>
          <p><strong>12. Hydration myths:</strong> Water isn't always enough; thirst is not a reliable indicator. Balanced sports drinks beat plain water in long matches.</p>
          <p><strong>13. Ready-to-mix sachets:</strong> Provide travel-friendly, reliable nutrition. Prevents guesswork and supports consistent intake.</p>
          <p><strong>14. QR-based assistant:</strong> Scanning a code gives athletes tailored hydration & nutrition guidance—great for coaches & players on-the-go.</p>
          <p><strong>15. Why traditional drinks fail:</strong> Sugary drinks don’t restore electrolytes or offer performance support. Zenith Zap provides optimized hydration and fuel.</p>
